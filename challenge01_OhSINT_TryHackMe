The investigation leveraged passive reconnaissance techniques using publicly available information across multiple platforms. Tools included:

* `exiftool` (metadata extraction)
* GitHub OSINT enumeration
* Twitter profile analysis
* Wigle.net for Wi-Fi geolocation
* HTML source code analysis
* Cross-referencing across WordPress, GitHub, and social media platforms

## üõ°Ô∏è Analyst's Note

This challenge demonstrates how public digital footprints ‚Äî even minimal ‚Äî can be cross-referenced to reconstruct an individual's identity, location, habits, and even credentials. It reinforces the importance of operational security (OPSEC) 
in public platforms, particularly for developers and content creators.
