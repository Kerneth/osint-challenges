![Wix EgotisticalBank](images/wix_egotisticalbank_home.png)

**Observation:**  
In the blog post titled *"On holiday"*, Roland writes:

> "Should I get Twitter to post holiday pics??"  
> "Whilst on my travels I'll be sure to review the best hangouts I find ‚Äì I'm a sucker for a good cup of java (not the programming language :D)"

These comments suggest he might have shared updates during his trip on Twitter, possibly using a review-related account.

### üêá Misleads & Rabbit Holes

**1. False Twitter Match ‚Äì Wrong Roland Sanchez**  
During the initial phase of the investigation, I found a Twitter account belonging to a user named *Roland Sanchez*. At first glance, it seemed relevant, but after analyzing the profile, it became clear that the account had been inactive since **2013**.  
Given that the business trip in question refers to "**2020 UK TOUR DATES**", this profile was excluded as irrelevant.

**2. Reverse Image Search on LinkedIn Profile Picture**  
I attempted to verify the authenticity of Roland Sanchez's LinkedIn profile picture using **Yandex reverse image search**. The search revealed that the photo is likely a **royalty-free stock image**, which suggests that the individual is **fictional** and was created specifically for the purpose of the OSINT challenge.
