### Clue 2 – EgotisticalBank's Wix Website**

* **Approach:**
  Continued the investigation by analyzing the official Wix website of EgotisticalBank.
* **Observation:**
  In the blog post titled "On holiday", Roland writes:

    "Should I get Twitter to post holiday pics??"
    "Whilst on my travels I'll be sure to review the best hangouts I find – I'm a sucker for a good cup of java (not the programming language :D)"

These comments suggest he might have shared updates during his trip on Twitter, possibly using a review-related account.

This investigation demonstrates how seemingly trivial online posts — such as travel plans or casual jokes — can lead to critical information when correlated across platforms. 
It also underlines the power of OSINT in reconstructing a digital footprint without direct access to private data. By tracing Roland Sanchez’s online presence, 
we were able to locate a key post confirming his whereabouts and solve the challenge.
